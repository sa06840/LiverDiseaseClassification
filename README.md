# LiverDiseaseClassification

For this project, I compared the performance of two machine learning algorithms—Naïve Bayes and Random Forest—on predicting liver disease based on patient data from the Indian Liver Patient Dataset. I implemented extensive hyperparameter fine-tuning to optimise model accuracy and evaluated both algorithms' effectiveness in classification tasks. This project enhanced my understanding of supervised machine learning techniques and the importance of hyperparameter optimisation. Implemented on MATLAB.
